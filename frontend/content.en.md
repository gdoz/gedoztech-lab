# 🏠 Overview

> *“Learning by building — from Hello Worlds to real, deployable MVPs.”*

The **GedozTech Lab** is a personal yet professional-grade technology organization that operates as a **real-world product and engineering laboratory**.  
It simulates how modern tech companies structure, design, build, test, secure, deploy, manage, and evolve software products — with full transparency and public visibility.  

- ***Quick access**: If you wish, you can jump to the [Product Lines](#product-lines) section, the **Git repositories** [MVP Foundry Lab](#product-repositories-source-code), and [Hello World Atlas](#product-repositories-source-code-2), or directly [get in touch](#about-the-lab-founder).*


The Lab exists with two core purposes:

1. **To learn, teach, and demonstrate excellence in product, process, and engineering.**
2. **To deliver real applications across multiple domains and platforms — forming a living, evolving portfolio.**

This **living technology ecosystem** demonstrates capabilities across:

- Modern Software Engineering  
- Digital Product Management  
- Lean Delivery & Flow Practices  
- Cloud, DevOps & Platform Engineering  
- Security Engineering & DevSecOps Foundations  
- Architecture & Design Principles  
- Multi-platform Development (Web, Mobile, Smart TV, Wearable, IoT, Automotive, etc.)  
- Experimentation, Discovery & Continuous Improvement  

It is a place where ideas evolve into products, and products evolve into knowledge.


# 🎯 Mission

To build a transparent, public, multi-product technology ecosystem that demonstrates excellence in modern software engineering, product thinking, cloud-first delivery, process discipline, and cross-platform development while enabling continuous learning and experimentation.



# 🌅 Vision

To become a comprehensive, multi-platform, multi-product environment that reflects the sophistication of a real, high-performance software organization — while remaining public, educational, open, and inspiring.

This vision guides how repositories are documented, how boards are structured, how pipelines run, how discovery happens, and how products evolve.



# ⚖️ Strategic Principles

These principles define how the Lab makes decisions across product, process, and engineering.

## Product Principles
- **Value-driven**: every product belongs to a Product Line and exists for a reason.  
- **Outcome over output**: success means clarity, usefulness, and learning — not only delivery.  
- **Iterative by design**: MVP → V2 → V3 → continuous evolution.  
- **Discovery-first**: no implementation begins without understanding the problem and solution space.

## Engineering Principles
- Simplicity over accidental complexity  
- Sustainable speed over short-term hacks  
- Reproducibility through automation  
- Security by default  
- Documentation as a deliverable  
- CI/CD from day zero  
- Infrastructure-as-Code wherever applicable  

## Organizational Principles
- **Transparency**: open boards, open documentation, open processes.  
- **Standardization**: shared patterns and conventions across all products.  
- **Autonomy with alignment**: each application evolves independently but within a unified governance model.  
- **Continuous improvement**: the Lab improves itself over time.



# 🧭 Governance & Operating Philosophy

The Lab operates as a **mini-tech organization**, with lightweight but rigorous governance designed to simulate how mature product and engineering teams function in real companies.

This governance ensures that:

- every product is intentional  
- every iteration is traceable  
- every engineering practice is demonstrable  
- every insight feeds continuous improvement  
- the Lab behaves as a cohesive ecosystem, not a random collection of repositories  



# ⚙️ Operating Model

## Product Lines & Mini-Products

The Lab is structured into **Product Lines**, each containing multiple applications.  
Every application is treated as a **mini-product** with its own lifecycle, success criteria, stack, documentation, and governance.

## Process Method & Framework

The primary delivery system is **Kanban**, applied not as a board but as a **thinking model**:

- Visualize work  
- Limit work in progress  
- Manage flow  
- Improve collaboratively  
- Deliver continuously  

Scrum and other frameworks may be adopted for future product lines.

## Product Lifecycle

Every mini-product follows a consistent lifecycle:

### **Discovery**
Understand the problem, define scope and constraints, select stack and platform, and outline architecture, DevEx/UX, and initial technical direction.

### **Delivery**
Build minimum viable value, implement tests, establish security controls, set up CI/CD, automate, deploy, and measure flow.

### **Learning & Insights**
Analyze flow efficiency, cycle time, lead time, health signals, developer experience, maintainability, and (when relevant) cloud cost.

Continuous refinement drives continuous evolution.

## Multi-Platform Development

The Lab spans a highly diverse ecosystem:

- Web  
- Mobile  
- Smart TV  
- Automotive  
- Wearables  
- IoT  
- Cloud-native services  
- Backend systems  
- Algorithms as “micro-products”  
- DevOps and Security automation  

This mirrors the breadth of a modern industry-scale tech organization.

## Tooling Ecosystem

The Lab intentionally uses **multiple tool ecosystems** to demonstrate adaptability and practical operational experience.

### Management & Boards
- Jira  
- Azure Boards  
- GitHub Projects & Issues  
- GitLab Issues & Boards  
- Trello  
- Google Sheets (master product index)

### Code Repositories
- GitHub  
- GitLab  
- Azure Repos  
- Bitbucket  

### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions  
- GitLab CI  
- Azure Pipelines  
- Bitbucket Pipelines  
- AWS CodePipeline  

### Infrastructure-as-Code
- Terraform  
- CloudFormation  

Different products use different toolchains — simulating real enterprise heterogeneity.

### Cloud Platforms
- AWS  
- Azure  
- Google Cloud Platform  
- Magalu Cloud  
- Oracle Cloud  

Each cloud is adopted selectively based on product purpose and educational value.



# 📐 Processes

> *"Kanban is not just a board — it is the operating system of the Lab."*

### Kanban Implementation

GedozTech Lab uses a **dual-lane Kanban system**:

- **Discovery (Upstream)**  
- **Delivery (Downstream)**  

Both coexist in a unified flow pipeline.

### Core Policies

- Clear WIP limits  
- Definition of Ready (Initial Checklist)  
- Definition of Done (Closing Checklist)  
- Review expectations  
- Testing & security baselines  
- No new work starts if WIP is full  
- Kaizen log for process evolution  

### Core Kanban Artifacts

- Kanban Policy  
- Checklists (DoR/DoD)  
- Board Guidelines  
- Public Boards  
- Process Notes  
- Kaizen Log  
- Retrospectives  
- Metrics & Insights Dashboard  

### Idea → Discovery → Delivery Flow

1. Ideas are first registered in a public Google Sheets product index.  
2. Automated scripts generate tasks across the Lab’s management platforms.  
3. Discovery begins and flows naturally into Delivery.  
4. Delivery produces value and insights for continuous improvement.



# 📊 Metrics & Insights

> *“Measuring progress, not performance.”*

Metrics are tracked globally and per product line to understand flow, stability, and efficiency across the ecosystem.

### Core Metrics
- **Lead Time**  
- **Cycle Time**  
- **Throughput**  
- **WIP**  
- **Flow Efficiency**  
- **Blockers & Waiting Time**  

Dashboards aggregate signals from all boards and tools to support learning and decision-making.


# 🧭 Product Lines

> *“How the GedozTech Lab organizes and evolves multiple products at scale.”*

The Lab currently contains two major **Product Lines**, each with a distinct strategic role in the ecosystem.  
New lines will be added over time as the Lab grows.


## 📂 Global Application Index

All applications, stacks, and platforms across every Product Line are catalogued in a public spreadsheet:

👉 **Global Application Index**  
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dyFXvGS-rbODOxoDIiyk9cxLhO9ioEQgI2s4JlchYO4  

This index is the *single source of truth* for:
- which applications exist  
- which Product Line they belong to  
- which platform, language, and stack they use  
- their current lifecycle status (Planned, In Progress, Done, etc.)



# 💠 MVP Foundry Lab  
> *“A real-product engineering track.”*

This Product Line simulates a **real engineering organization** delivering actual, meaningful products:

- realistic feature scope  
- production-grade stacks  
- CI/CD from day one  
- automated testing and security baselines  
- deployable artifacts and environments  

Each mini-product exercises **full-cycle product development**:  
**Discovery → Delivery → Deployment → Evolution** — involving product reasoning, architecture, implementation, testing, deployment, and iteration.
